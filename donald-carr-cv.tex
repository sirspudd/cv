\section*{Objective}

I thrive in, and seek, a dynamic environment where I can play a multitude of technical roles and will be exposed to a variety of problems. I have found both development and technical support roles distinctly rewarding, and will whole-heartedly embrace any opportunity to further develop my existing Linux/C++ skills. Above all else, I want to be a productive and resourceful member of a lively talented team, and to provide a tangible invaluable contribution in the face of any challenges this team may face.

		\item{	``Best Computer Science Honours Project", 2005 }
			\begin{itemize*}
			\item{Title: ``Adapting Reinforcement Learning to Tetris"}
			\item{Abstract: 
				``This paper discusses the application of reinforcement learning to Tetris. Tetris and reinforcement learning are both introduced and defined, and relevant research is discussed. An agent based on existing research is implemented and investigated. A reduced representation of the Tetris state space is then developed, and several new agents are implemented around this state space. The implemented agents all display successful learning, and show proficiency within certain conditions."}
