\textbf{Objective:} Play a key role in developing and shipping desirable hardware/software which sees broad adoption and tangible market success.
%I thrive in, and seek, a dynamic environment where I can play a multitude of technical roles and will be exposed to a variety of problems. I have found both development and technical support roles distinctly rewarding, and will whole-heartedly embrace any opportunity to further develop my existing Linux/C++ skills. Above all else, I want to be a productive and resourceful member of a lively talented team, and to provide a tangible invaluable contribution in the face of any challenges this team may face.
